# Project Summary — Automation Fundamentals Research & Workflow Simulation (Oct 2020)

**Institution:** Keshav Memorial Institute of Commerce and Sciences (KMICS)  
**Type:** Academic research + seminar presentation (reconstructed demo repository)

## Objective
Study industrial automation and software automation concepts, including RPA-style workflows, and evaluate efficiency using data scraping + workflow simulation.

## Work Completed
- Researched industrial automation + RPA workflow models
- Built a small web scraping pipeline in Python (BeautifulSoup + Pandas) to collect and preprocess automation-related text data
- Simulated manual vs automated workflow performance in MATLAB using generated task-time distributions
- Created seminar materials and maintained a simple seminar web portal (HTML/CSS)

## Evidence in this Repo
- `python/rpa_web_scraping_demo.py` — scraping + preprocessing demo
- `matlab/automation_workflow_simulation.m` — workflow efficiency simulation demo
- `seminar-portal/` — seminar website demo
